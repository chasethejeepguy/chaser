# Sierra 1500 Duplicate Info Icon Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The Sierra 1500 (and other GMC models) were showing **two blue info icons** for each feature:
- One icon on the **left** side of the feature name (added via `prepend`)
- One icon on the **right** side of the feature name (added during initial HTML generation)

## Root Cause
The problem was that certain GMC models were using **both** approaches to add info icons:

1. **Initial HTML Generation**: Icons were added to the HTML string during feature population
2. **Post-Processing Prepend**: Additional icons were prepended to labels after HTML insertion

## Models Affected
Three GMC models had this duplicate icon issue:
- **Terrain** (lines 1607 + 1703)
- **Sierra 1500** (lines 1905 + 1974) 
- **Acadia** (lines 2179 + 2275)

## Models NOT Affected
These models only use initial HTML generation (no duplicates):
- **Yukon** (line 2478 only)
- **Canyon** (line 2753 only)

## Fix Applied
Removed the duplicate prepend logic from the three affected models by replacing the prepend code blocks with comments:

### Before (Problematic Code):
```javascript
htmlBlock.find('.gchoice').each(function() {
    var $div = $(this);
    var $input = $div.find('input[type="checkbox"]');
    var $label = $div.find('label');
    var feature = $label.text().trim();
    if (feature) {
        var matchedFeature = Object.keys(featureDescriptions).find(function(key) {
            return fuzzyMatch(key, feature, 'SIERRA 1500', feature);
        });
        if (matchedFeature && !$div.find('.feature-info-icon[data-feature="' + matchedFeature + '"]').length) {
            $label.prepend('<span class="feature-info-icon" data-feature="' + matchedFeature + '">i</span>');
            console.log('Prepended info icon for feature: ' + feature);
        }
    }
});
```

### After (Fixed Code):
```javascript
// Info icons are already included in the initial HTML generation above
// No need to prepend additional icons to avoid duplicates
```

## Result
- **Sierra 1500**, **Terrain**, and **Acadia** now show only **one blue info icon** per feature (on the right side)
- Info icons maintain all functionality (click handlers, descriptions, etc.)
- No duplicate icons or visual clutter
- Consistent behavior across all GMC models

## Additional Notes
- The info icons are generated during initial HTML creation with proper styling and positioning
- All click handlers and feature description functionality remain intact
- The fix maintains consistency with **Yukon** and **Canyon** models that were already working correctly

## Files Modified
- `WORKING AS OF 7 12.HTML` - Removed duplicate prepend logic from three GMC model functions

## Status
âœ… **FIXED** - Sierra 1500 and other affected GMC models now show single info icons as expected
