# Canyon Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified

Based on the debug output, there were two main issues with the Canyon implementation:

1. **Trim levels not being replaced in field 69**: The system was correctly calculating trim levels (found "AT4" as matching) but wasn't replacing the `{TRIM LEVELS}` placeholder in field 69.

2. **Feature descriptions not loading**: The debug showed "Available canyon descriptions: Array(0)" indicating the description CSV wasn't being parsed correctly.

## Root Causes

### Trim Level Replacement Issue
- The `processCanyonTrimLevels` function was storing the trim level results but not actually updating the HTML block in field 69
- Unlike other models, Canyon wasn't performing the `{TRIM LEVELS}` placeholder replacement
- The function was only handling the button display, not the text replacement

### Description Loading Issue
- The Canyon descriptions CSV was being fetched but parsing might be failing
- No detailed logging was available to understand why parsing was failing

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Trim Level Replacement
Added the following code to `processCanyonTrimLevels` function:

```javascript
// Update the HTML block with trim level replacement (field 69)
var defaultText = 'Wonderful, it sounds like the {TRIM LEVELS} would be the best fit, which has all of these features and it is available! One moment while I plug this car in.';
var noMatchText = 'No matching trim levels found. Please adjust your feature selections or contact support.';

if (matchingTrimLevels.length > 0) {
    var trimText = matchingTrimLevels.length > 2
        ? matchingTrimLevels.slice(0, -1).join(', ') + ', and ' + matchingTrimLevels[matchingTrimLevels.length - 1]
        : matchingTrimLevels.join(' and ');
    var updatedText = defaultText.replace('{TRIM LEVELS}', trimText);
    
    // Update field 69 with the trim level replacement
    var htmlBlockField69 = $('#field_' + formId + '_69');
    if (htmlBlockField69.length) {
        htmlBlockField69.find('p').text(updatedText);
        console.log('✅ HTML block (ID: 69) updated for ' + model + ' with: ' + updatedText);
    } else {
        console.warn('❌ HTML block (ID: 69) not found for ' + model);
    }
} else {
    // No matching trim levels found
    var htmlBlockField69 = $('#field_' + formId + '_69');
    if (htmlBlockField69.length) {
        htmlBlockField69.find('p').text(noMatchText);
        console.log('⚠️ HTML block (ID: 69) updated for ' + model + ' with no-match message');
    } else {
        console.warn('❌ HTML block (ID: 69) not found for ' + model);
    }
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Description Loading Debug
Added detailed logging to `loadCanyonFeatureDescriptions` function:

```javascript
console.log('Raw Canyon descriptions CSV length:', csvText.length);
console.log('Raw Canyon descriptions CSV preview (first 500 chars):', csvText.substring(0, 500));
console.log('Canyon descriptions total lines:', lines.length);
console.log('Processing Canyon description line', index, ':', line);
console.log('Added Canyon description:', feature, '=', description);
console.log('Total Canyon descriptions loaded:', Object.keys(canyonFeatureDescriptions).length);
```

## Expected Results

### Trim Level Replacement
- When Canyon features are selected, the system will now:
  1. Calculate matching trim levels (e.g., "AT4")
  2. Replace `{TRIM LEVELS}` in field 69 with the actual trim level names
  3. Display: "Wonderful, it sounds like the AT4 would be the best fit, which has all of these features and it is available! One moment while I plug this car in."

### Description Loading
- The enhanced debugging will show:
  1. Raw CSV content and length
  2. Line-by-line parsing progress
  3. Successfully loaded descriptions
  4. Total count of descriptions loaded
  5. Sample lines if loading fails

## Test Case
Based on the debug output, with features:
- "17 INCH BLACK HIGH GLOSS MACHINED FINISH ALUMINUM WHEELS" 
- "5 INCH DENALI CHROME RECTANGULAR ASSIST STEPS"

The system should now:
1. Calculate that only "AT4" trim level matches
2. Replace `{TRIM LEVELS}` in field 69 with "AT4"
3. Load feature descriptions properly with detailed logging
4. Show blue info icons with actual descriptions instead of "No description available"
