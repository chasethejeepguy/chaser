# GMC Terrain Feature Matching Fix

## Problem Description

The GMC Terrain feature selection system was not properly matching selected checkbox features with the CSV data to filter trim levels. The debug logs showed:

1. **Selected features were truncated**: Checkboxes showing "19" and "20" instead of full feature names like `"19" TECHNICAL GRAY MACHINED FACE ALUMINUM WHEELS"`
2. **No matching trim levels**: All trim levels were being rejected because features couldn't be matched
3. **Quote handling issues**: CSV feature names contained quotes that weren't properly escaped/unescaped

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Feature Name Mismatch**: The checkbox values were being set correctly with full feature names, but somewhere in the process they were being truncated to just "19" and "20"
2. **Exact Matching Only**: The system only supported exact string matching between selected features and CSV column headers
3. **Quote Escaping**: HTML attribute values with quotes needed proper escaping/unescaping

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Feature Matching with Fuzzy Logic

Added intelligent fuzzy matching in `processTerrainTrimLevels()` function:

```javascript
// If exact match not found, try fuzzy matching
if (columnIndex === undefined) {
    var bestMatch = null;
    var bestScore = 0;
    var threshold = 0.3;
    
    Object.keys(featureToColumnMap).forEach(function(csvFeature) {
        var score = 0;
        
        // Check if the selected feature is contained in the CSV feature
        if (csvFeature.toLowerCase().includes(feature.toLowerCase())) {
            score = 0.8; // High score for containment
        }
        // Check if CSV feature starts with the selected feature
        else if (csvFeature.toLowerCase().startsWith(feature.toLowerCase())) {
            score = 0.7;
        }
        // Additional fuzzy matching logic...
    });
}
```

### 2. Proper Quote Escaping/Unescaping

**During HTML Generation:**
```javascript
// Escape quotes in the value attribute
var escapedFeature = feature.replace(/"/g, '&quot;');
html += '<input ... value="' + escapedFeature + '" ...>';
```

**During Feature Retrieval:**
```javascript
feature = $input.attr('value') || '';
// Unescape HTML entities in the value
feature = feature.replace(/&quot;/g, '"');
```

### 3. Enhanced Debugging

Added comprehensive debugging to track feature values through the entire process:

- Debug checkbox value setting during HTML generation
- Debug checkbox value retrieval during feature collection
- Debug fuzzy matching attempts with scores
- Debug trim level matching results

### 4. Improved Result Display

Enhanced the trim level popup to show:
- Matched features with their original names
- Feature matching details for each trim level
- Clear indication when fuzzy matching was used

## Expected Behavior

Now when a user selects features:

1. **"19" checkbox** → Matches `"19" TECHNICAL GRAY MACHINED FACE ALUMINUM WHEELS"` (if available in ELEVATION)
2. **"20" checkbox** → Matches `"20" AFTER MIDNIGHT MACHINED FACE ALUMINUM WHEELS"` (if available in DENALI)
3. **"FORWARD COLLISION ALERT"** → Exact match (available in all trim levels)
4. **"TEEN DRIVER"** → Exact match (available in all trim levels)

The system will:
- Find all trim levels that have "YES" for ALL selected features
- Display matching trim levels in the `{TRIM LEVELS}` placeholder
- Show detailed matching information in the popup

## Files Modified

- `WORKING AS OF 7 12.HTML`: Enhanced feature matching logic, quote handling, and debugging

## Testing

The fix should now properly handle:
- Partial feature name matches (e.g., "19" matching "19 inch wheels")
- Features with quotes and special characters
- Combined feature selections across all categories (EXTERIOR, INTERIOR, MECHANICAL, SAFETY, PACKAGES)
- Proper trim level filtering based on CSV "YES" values

## Next Steps

1. Test the functionality with various feature combinations
2. Verify that the `{TRIM LEVELS}` placeholder is properly replaced with matching trim levels
3. Ensure the popup shows accurate feature matching details
4. Monitor debug logs to confirm feature matching is working correctly
